* So if I wanted to mirror the values,
* I could place a shadow 15px under it,

// Father God, your presence in my life is like a beautiful shadow, adding depth and warmth to everything around me.
// Just like this text-shadow effect, you make my world brighter and more vibrant. Je t'aime plus que tout.
